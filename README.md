# Personal-Journal
This is a program to keep track of your activities. If you have a goal of completing a type of physical activity, 
then this journal will help you keep track of what you did and the amount of time you took.
For example, if you wanted to get your mile time for running under 10 mins, you can document
your progress and see what your time was last time. This is a journal to help you keep track of
your final goal or it can help you make sure you are being active each day.
